# Myeloma Genome Project 1000
Comprehensive bioinformatics pipeline for the large-scale collaborative analysis of Multiple Myeloma genomes in an effort to deliniate the broad spectrum of somatic events

## Pipeline Overview
In order to analyze over one thousand matched tumor/normal whole-genome samples across multiple data centers in a consistent manner, a pipeline was created that leverages the workflow management, portability, and reproducibility of [Nextflow](http://www.nextflow.io/) in conjuction with [Singularity](https://sylabs.io/docs/).

The entire pipeline is divided into 3 steps: Preprocessing, Germline Variant Analysis, and Somatic Variant Analysis
This compartmentalizes the workflow and provides significant completion checkpoints which is effective for large-scale batch processing.

## Running the Pipeline
The pipeline was developed to be run on various HPCs without concern of environment incompatabilities, version issues, or missing dependencies. However, there are a few assumptions regarding initial setup of the pipeline but the required software should be readily available in nearly all HPC environments.
